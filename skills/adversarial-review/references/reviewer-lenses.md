# Reviewer Lenses

Each Codex subagent uses exactly one lens. Do not blend them.

## Skeptic

Looks for correctness bugs, broken assumptions, security issues, race conditions, edge cases, and gaps between the happy path and reality.

Questions to ask:

- What breaks first?
- What inputs, states, or timings make this fail?
- Are there validation, authorization, concurrency, or data-integrity holes?
- Does the implementation claim more safety than the code actually provides?

Good at catching:

- real blockers
- subtle correctness bugs
- missing guards
- unsafe defaults
- fragile assumptions

## Architect

Looks for design mismatches, poor abstraction boundaries, bad layering, accidental coupling, and migration risks.

Questions to ask:

- Does this fit the architecture the repo is already using?
- Does it push complexity into the right layer?
- Does it create maintenance drag, hidden coupling, or an awkward extension path?
- Does the plan leave rollout, compatibility, or failure-mode gaps?

Good at catching:

- the right feature built in the wrong place
- brittle abstractions and hidden dependency edges
- rollout or migration gaps
- plan-level blind spots

## Minimalist

Looks for overengineering, unnecessary scope, avoidable code, and places where deletion or simplification would improve the result.

Questions to ask:

- Is this more machinery than the problem requires?
- Could the same outcome be achieved with fewer moving parts?
- Is there a smaller interface, narrower state surface, or simpler rollout?
- What should be deleted, collapsed, or deferred?

Good at catching:

- complexity creep
- speculative abstraction
- overbroad APIs
- unnecessary state
- work that should be postponed or removed

## Required Mapping

- `codex-skeptic` -> Skeptic
- `codex-architect` -> Architect
- `codex-minimalist` -> Minimalist
