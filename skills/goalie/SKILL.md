description: Use when the user wants to turn a rough idea, dirty goal, messy long-run prompt, sidechat thought, or under-scoped Codex task into clean Goal objective text under 4000 characters. Produce a ready-to-use Goal without the `/goal` prefix. Do not use for normal one-off prompts, ordinary implementation plans, brainstorming with no intended Codex Goal, or starting a Goal unless explicitly asked.

# Goalie

Turn rough intent into clean Goal objective text for Codex.

## Core Rule

Default output is draft-only Goal text.
- Do not include `/goal`.
- Keep the Goal objective text under 4000 characters.
- Do not call goal tools or start a Goal unless the user explicitly asks in the current request.
- Prefer one strong Goal over a menu of options.
- If the task is too small or too vague for a Goal, say so and give a better normal prompt or the next clarifying question.

## Goal Fit Test

Use a Goal when the work has:
- a durable objective that may take multiple turns
- a finish line Codex can audit with evidence
- a path that may change after investigation

Do not use a Goal for:
- one-line edits
- simple explanations
- short reviews
- normal plans that stop after one answer
- vague requests with no meaningful evidence source

## Workflow

1. Extract the user's actual target:
- desired end state
- why this needs a longer Codex run
- likely workspace, repo, file, artifact, test, benchmark, source, or evidence surface
- realistic verification environment when the result depends on deploys, devices, data, flags, auth, browsers, or external systems
- whether visual material is context, evidence, or the actual finish line

2. Build the completion contract:
- Outcome: what must be true when done
- Evidence: tests, benchmark, report, artifact, command output, source material, or runtime check that proves it
- Environment: the real or production-like surface Codex should use to verify the result; if unavailable, state the limitation
- Progress tracking: for long goals, milestone commits, a status artifact, draft PR, or update cadence
- Constraints: what must not regress or be changed
- Boundaries: allowed files, tools, repos, data, time, or scope limits
- Iteration policy: how Codex should choose the next action between attempts
- Visual guardrails: for visual goals, prefer feature checklists, design-system adherence, accessibility, and real UI inspection over pure pixel matching; forbid fake matches such as cropping or inlining a reference image
- Finalization: review the final diff/artifacts, remove failed experiments, rerun relevant checks, and report residual risk
- Blocked stop: when Codex should stop and report the blocker plus what would unlock progress

3. Ask only for missing critical details. If a reasonable default exists, use it and list it under `Assumptions`.

4. Draft the Goal as compact objective text the user can paste after `/goal`.

5. Self-check before final output:
- no `/goal` prefix
- Goal objective text is under 4000 characters
- no fake certainty
- no broad "make it better" wording
- includes evidence and constraints when available
- includes environment, progress tracking, visual guardrails, and finalization when they affect success
- says what to report if blocked

## Writing Standard

Goal text should be clear and compressed, not exhaustive.
- Lead with the desired end state.
- Use concrete nouns, direct verbs, and parallel clauses.
- Cut filler, backstory, repeated caveats, and process narration.
- Put secondary context in `Why this works` or `Assumptions`, not inside the Goal.
- If the draft approaches 4000 characters, shorten it before returning it.

## Output Shape

Use this format:

```text
Goal:
[ready-to-use Goal objective text, no /goal prefix]

Why this works:
- Outcome: ...
- Evidence: ...
- Environment: ...
- Progress tracking: ...
- Constraints: ...
- Boundaries: ...
- Iteration policy: ...
- Visual guardrails: ...
- Finalization: ...
- Blocked stop: ...

Assumptions:
- ...

Optional sharper version:
[alternate Goal objective text, no /goal prefix]
```

Omit non-applicable `Why this works` lines except `Outcome`, `Evidence`, and `Blocked stop`.
Omit `Optional sharper version` unless it gives a materially better tradeoff.

If the prompt is not Goal-worthy, use this format:

```text
This should be a normal prompt, not a Goal:
[better one-off prompt or concise reason]
```

## Current-Thread Goal Starts

If the user explicitly asks to start a Goal in the current thread, first produce the cleaned Goal text and confirm it has a real evidence surface. Only then use the host's Goal tool or command if available and allowed by the current environment.

## Failure Modes

- Including `/goal` even though the user wants to add it themselves.
- Returning Goal objective text at or above 4000 characters.
- Starting a Goal when the user only asked for draft text.
- Turning normal planning into a Goal.
- Omitting verification, constraints, or blocker handling.
- Asking broad intake questions instead of making safe assumptions.
